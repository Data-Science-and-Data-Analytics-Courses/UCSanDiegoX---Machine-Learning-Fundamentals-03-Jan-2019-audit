# Run Jupyter notebooks in Google Colaboratory
The following ways can be used to load a GitHub-hosted notebook in [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb#recent=true).
* Use this GitHub repository's url (subsequent GitHub sign-in is required) to open the notebook directly from GitHub.
* Click on the [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)]() badge on the top of the GitHub notebook displayed on the website (subsequent GitHub sign-in is required).
* Save the notebook to Google Drive, then open it from Google Drive.
* Download the notebook to the computer/device, then upload it to Google Colab.
